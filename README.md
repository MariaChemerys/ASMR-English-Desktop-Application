# ASMR-English-Desktop-Application
Different items that can produce calming ASMR sounds (ice water, soapy sponges, kinetic sand, etc.) randomly appear on the screen and fall down slowly. Each item has a letter on it. The player must collect all letters to win by clicking on them. When an item is collected, the player hears a calming sound.
